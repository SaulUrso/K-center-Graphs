# Barabasi-Albert Graphs

## Filenames explanation

* Nx: the graph has x nodes
* Xx: in each iteration the algorithm attaches x edges from a new node to existing nodes
* SGx: used x seed for graph generation
* SVx: used x seed for node weights and edges lenghts generation
* MRx: x is max range value for node weights and edges lenghts
