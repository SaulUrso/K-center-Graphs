# Newman-Watts-Strogatz graphs

## Filename explanation

* Nx: x nodes in the graph
* Kx:Each node is joined with its x nearest neighbors in a ring topology
* Px: the probability of adding a new edge for each edge
* SGx: used seed x to generate the graph
* SVx: used seed x to generate node weights and edges length
* MRx: x is max range value for node weights and edges lenghts
